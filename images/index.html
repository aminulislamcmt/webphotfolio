            <h3>Become world's no. 1 Developer</h3>
            <P>My biggest dream is that through the right education we will be able to help people understand, that their survival depends on the positive, selfless, mutually responsible and mutually complementing connection, cooperation between them on a global scale.</P>

            <p>My method of learning goes something like this, We first start of with going through lots and lots of theory, much like you did in high school, but we never try and memorize this and its only for getting a quick overview and understanding of what we are dealing with.</p>
